# Summary
Coded a logistic classifier, random forest classifier, and data processing file that was used to identify key features in predicting user churn for a ride-sharing company based on a dataset from a cohort of users. Able to identify that luxury car usage in the first 30 days, smartphone type, and city were the most predictive features for predicting user churn.

# Methodology

EDA: We examined the correlation matrix between sets of features, analyzed segmented churn rates, user propensity, and scatter matrices to understand the shape and nature of user behavior in regards to churn.

Model: We used logistic regression and random forest models to predict churn based on engineered features done during EDA.

# Results
We were able to validate initial assumptions regarding feature importance based on the results of our random forest model, where features such as luxury car usage, city, and phone type were predictive features of churn.
