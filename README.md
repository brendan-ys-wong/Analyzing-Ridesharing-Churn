# Summary
A ride-sharing company is interesting in predicting rider retention. Our team performed exploratory data analysis on the data set and designed model features and implemented a logistic classification and random forest classification models to predict user churn.

# Methodology

EDA: We examined the correlation matrix between sets of features, analyzed segmented churn rates, user propensity, and scatter matrices to understand the shape and nature of user behavior in regards to churn.

Model: We used logistic regression and random forest models to predict churn based on engineered features done during EDA.

# Outcome
We were able to validate initial assumptions regarding feature importance based on the results of our random forest model, where features such as luxury car usage, city, and phone type were predictive features of churn.

# Future Work
Draft up strategic recommendations to company on how to minimize churn for new users to the platform, as well as recommending which user groups are the most profitable to the company at this current company stage.
